# CS 210 Project One
## Summary
For this project, I created two clocks: one showing 12-hour time and the other 24-hour time. Additionally, I developed a menu that allows users to add an hour, a minute, a second, or exit the program completely.
## What did I do well?
In this project, I excelled at organizing the asterisks around the clock and the displayed menu.
## Where could I enhance my code?
The code can be enhanced by organizing it more effectively and making it neater.
## What did I find most challenging?
Correctly aligning the asterisks took time and effort, but I successfully completed the task. By experimenting with the code, I gained a better understanding of it and developed patience.
## What skills are transferable?
This project showed me that simplicity and efficiency are often the most practical approach. It emphasized the importance of not overcomplicating tasks unnecessarily.
## How did I make it readable?
Keeping the code straightforward and easy to read made programming and maintaining it easier for future changes or additions.
